      "description": "Suppose Adam, Ben, and Carl each received an inheritance of $200,000, and each used it immediately to purchase a house. Suppose that each of them sold the house a year after buying it. Economic conditions, however, were different in each case: \n When Adam owned the house, there was a 25% deflation—the prices of all goods and services decreased by approximately 25%. A year after Adam bought the house, he sold it for $154,000 (23% less than he paid). \nWhen Ben owned the house, there was no inflation or deflation — prices had not changed significantly during that year. He sold the house for $198,000 (1% less than he paid for it). \nWhen Carl owned the house, there was a 25% inflation — all prices increased by approximately 25%. A year after he bought the house, Carl sold it for $246,000 (23% more than he paid).",

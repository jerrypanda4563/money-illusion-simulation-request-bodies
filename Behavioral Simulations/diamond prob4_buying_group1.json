      "description": "Imagine that you are the head of a financial services firm located in Singapore, and that you are now about to sign a contract with a local corporation for the purchase of new computer systems, to be delivered to your firm in January, 1993. These computer systems are currently valued at $1000 apiece but, due to inflation, all prices, including those of computers and financial services, are expected to increase during the next couple of years. Experts’ best estimate is that prices in Singapore two years from now will be about 20% higher, with an equal likelihood that the increase will be higher or lower than 20%. The experts agree that a 10% increase in all prices is just as likely as a 30% increase. You have to sign the contract for the computer systems now. Full payment will be made only upon delivery in January, 1993.",

          "question": "Indicate your preference between the contracts by choosing the appropriate contract below: \nContract A: You agree to buy the computer systems (in 1993) at $1200 apiece, no matter what the price of computer systems is at that time. Thus, if inflation exceeds 20%, you will be paying for the computers less than the 1993-price; whereas if inflation is below 20%, you will be paying more than the 1993-price. Because you have agreed on a fixed price, your profit level will depend on the rate of inflation. \nContract B: You agree to buy the computer systems at 1993’s price. Thus, if inflation exceeds 20%, you will pay more than $1200, and if inflation is below 20%, you will pay less than $1200. Because the prices of both computer systems and financial services are tied to the rate of inflation, your “real” profit will remain essentially the same regardless of the rate of inflation.",

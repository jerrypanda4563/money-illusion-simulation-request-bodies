      "description": "Imagine that you are the head of a corporate division located in Singapore that produces office computer systems. You are now about to sign a contract with a local firm for the sale of new systems, to be delivered in January, 1993. \nThese computer systems are currently priced at $1000 apiece but, due to inflation, all prices, including production costs and computer prices, are expected to increase during the next couple of years. Experts’ best estimate is that prices in Singapore two years from now will be about 20% higher, with an equal likelihood that the increase will be higher or lower than 20%. The experts agree that a 10% increase in all prices is just as likely as a 30% increase. \nYou have to sign the contract for the computer systems now. Full payment will be made only upon delivery in January, 1993.",

          "question": "Indicate your preference between the contracts by choosing the appropriate contract below: \nContract A: You agree to sell the computer systems (in 1993) at $1200 a piece, no matter what the price of computer systems is at that time. Thus, if inflation is below 20% you will be getting more than the 1993-price; whereas, if inflation exceeds 20% you will be getting less than the 1993-price. Because you have agreed on a fixed price, your profit level will depend on the rate of inflation. \nContract B: You agree to sell the computer systems at 1993’s price. Thus, if inflation exceeds 20%, you will be paid more than $1200, and if inflation is below 20%, you will be paid less than $1200. Because both production costs and prices are tied to the rate of inflation, your “real” profit will remain essentially the same regardless of the rate of inflation.",
